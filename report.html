      <h1>Report – A rational for the decision decisions made for this website</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Why this website has a good design</h2>
        <p>
          The original website has been redesigned to be highly responsive, adaptable to users’ devices,
          accessible and constructed in accordance with best practice principles of web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          These design choices will maximise users’ experiences on your website, regardless of whether
          they are using a mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop computer. Major design decisions are
          outlined below.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
        <div class="two-col-layout">
          <p>
            The website is highly responsive to user’s preferences and functions correctly on mobile devices, tablets
            and computers. This will enable users to have an enhanced experience on any device
            that they use to access the website.
          </p>
          <p>The website is also displayed in a manner best suited to the user’s device and screen size. For example, on mobile
            devices, the menus display food items in a single-column format. On larger devices such as tablets and computers, the food items
            are displayed in a two-column format to utilise the increased screen size.</p>


          <p>
            All font sizes have been set to be responsive to user’s preferences. For example, if the user prefers a larger font size and
            has set this as their preference in their web browser, the website’s text will be increased to match the user’s preference.
          </p>

          <p>
            The website’s styling has also been included in a manner that does not require extra processing by mobile devices. Rather,
            devices with larger screen sizes such as laptops or desktop computers, which can handle extra processing, process the
            styling to produce two-column layouts. This design decision is per best practice in web development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moreover, all images used on the website have been included in two versions – one for larger screen sizes and one for smaller
            screens. This maximises users’ experience because, if a user is using a mobile device, their device does not need to reduce
            the size of large images. Images on the original website which were of lower quality or could not be effectively resized
            have not been included in the final website. It is recommended that alternative images be used instead of these.
          </p>
        </div>



        <section>
          <h2>Ease of use</h2>
          <div class="two-col-layout">
            <p>Several design decisions have been made to make the website very easy to use for various types of users.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Using a universally recognisable layout that is used on many other websites</li>
              <li>Including links to the website’s pages at the top and bottom of each page</li>
              <li> Including a link that returns users to the top of this page because it is lengthy. This ‘return-to-top’ link
                could be easily copied to other long web pages that are later added to the site
              </li>
              <li>Including a link to the home page in the form of a logo on every page</li>
              <li>Including a universally recognised ‘hamburger icon’ menu when the website is displayed on mobile devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By making the website easier to use, users’ experiences will be maximised.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Accessibility</h2>
          <div class="two-col-layout">
            <p>
              The website has been designed in conformance with important accessibility standards. This design ensures that all
              users can effectively view and interact with the website, regardless of special physical or cognitive requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, all links on the website are designed so that users with visual impairments who use screen readers can
              understand where the link will take them. Furthermore, the already-mentioned responsive text ensures that users can
              easily adjust the size of all text on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              For users who cannot load an image or who are using a screen reader, all images have alternative text that is displayed
              if the image cannot be rendered.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website’s colours have also been carefully selected to maximise readability. For example, the default black text
              contrasts well with the website’s background colours, which enables
              users with visual acuity issues to read the text more easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              All design decisions related to accessibility are in conformance with established web standards and will maximise all
              users’ experience in using this website.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Ease of maintenance and making changes</h2>
          <div class="two-col-layout">
            <p>
              The website has been programmed in manner that simplifies the process of fixing errors and making changes. For example, the
              website has been designed to be ‘modular’ which essentially means that different files have been used for different tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a change to one aspect of the website needs to be made, this can be easily accomplished by changing the code in the respective
              file, without needing to modify the other files.
            </p>
            <p>
              The programming included in the website is also of high quality and follows best practice principles. Apartment from being modular,
              the code is easy to read, well-documented with comments that explain the purpose of key parts and has been thoroughly tested.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Functionality</h2>
          <div class="two-col-layout">
            <p>The website is highly functional. All functionality of the original website has been preserved and several additions have been
              made to improve the website’s interactivity.
            </p>
            <h3>Enhancements include:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Combining the lunch, dinner and takeaway menus on to one page for ease of viewing</li>
              <li>Enabling users to switch between menus by simply clicking the corresponding menu’s button</li>
              <li>A fully functional takeaway application that works on mobile devices, tablets and computers</li>
              <li>The ability to automatically save and optionally restore the user’s previous order</li>
              <li>Interactivity to aid navigation. For example, in the takeaway menu application, when a user moves their mouse
                over a food item, it is highlighted.
              </li>
              <li>A confirmation page in the takeaway application that indicates to the user their selected foods, the respective
                quantities and item prices, and the total order cost.
              </li>
              <li>An online booking form that enables users to request a standard booking or one for larger groups or events
              </li>
              <li>Error detection in the online booking form and takeaway application that can identify if there are
                errors in the user’s input. The user is then prompted to correct their input.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
